What is contained in the emperor.png file?  It depends on how you look at it.  First open it in your favorite image viewer or editor.
(Second favorite is OK too.)  Then, browse to the emperor.html file and view it by following directions there.

Note that the html and png files must be accessed via a web server.  Accessing them directly via your local file system will not
work due to browser security constraints.
